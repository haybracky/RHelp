Vector vs Raster format

Vector: SVG, PDF, EPS, AI, PS

Raster: JPEG, PMG, TIFF, BMP

Raster images are coded as circles

Vector graphics are coded as vectors w/ lines & points

important for graphics b/c if you zoom on a raster photo, it gets pixelated but if you zoom on a vector photo it stays the same

Best to use vector format for graphs (some cases you can't avoid it... like a map or image that's already coded in raster format)

Can easily convert from vector to raster w/o losing much info but difficult to convert from raster to vector

Pixel dimension = physical size x resolution 

  dpi is resolution 
  
  as pixel dimension incr, the larger the file size
  
RGB vs CMYK

RGB = screens, red green blue, every pixel can produce one of each colour 

CMYK = printed, cyan magenta yellow shading 

careful making graphics b/c printing will produce cmyk 

Adobe packages have CMYK preview, or stick to primary colours

Graphics software

Don't use powerpoint for publication

  * Adobe photoshop / GIMP (pixel)
  * Adobe illustrator / Inscape (vector)

?ggplot2

# two main functions

# qplot -- for basic plots
## qplot(x=, y=, data=)

# ggplot -- for advanced functions

# want to use relative path name
getwd()

MyData<- read.csv("data/FallopiaData.csv") # put folder name in front to find it

qplot(x=Total, data=MyData) # creates frequency histogram of binned data for continuous variable

qplot(x=Scenario, data=MyData) # creates frequency histogram of each categorical level

qplot(x=Silene, y=Total, data=MyData) # creates scatterplot of Silene biomass to Total biomass
# note: slight trend which makes sense b/c Silene biomass is included in total biomass
# never do a stat test on two variables that include the same measurement

qplot(x=Nutrients, y=Total, data=MyData) # plots total biomass separated into 2 nutrient levels

qplot(x=Nutrients, y=Scenario, data=MyData) # categorical x categorical just shows the occurence of each combination
```
  
```{r Customizations in ggplot}
# binwidth changse bin size for histograms
qplot(x=Total, data=MyData, binwidth=10, breaks=seq(20,90,10)) # bins get wider, each bar contains wider range of points

# group for subsets of data

qplot(x=Silene, y=Total, data=MyData, 
      colour=Nutrients, size=I(5)) # using I= the identity function, tells R that you want to assign the size the value of 5

qplot(x=Silene, y=Fallopia, data=MyData,

qplot(x=Silene, y=Fallopia, data=MyData,
      colour=Nutrients, colour=I(rgb(0.5,0,1))) # use values from 0-1 to tell it how much of each colour, rgb to use

# use coolors to generate colour patterns
## produces hexadecimal code, copy into R

# colours for hisograms have parameters:
## colour and fill
qplot(x=Total, data=MyData, colour=Nutrients) # this just gives outline

# change position with posit

Keep the messsage clear, produce an image that can be read with as little distraction as possible
